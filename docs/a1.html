      <p>Resistence calculation:</p>
      <p>R = (V_supply - V_forward) / I</p>
      <p>red LED: (5-2.0)/0.02 = 3.0/0.02 = 150 Ohms</p>
      <p>white LED: (5-3.0)/0.02 = 3.0/0.02 = 100 Ohms</p>
      <p>blue LED: (5-3.0)/0.02 = 3.0/0.02 = 100 Ohms</p>

      <pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;My Arduino Code!&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;// variables
int pin1=13;
int pin2=12;
int pin3=11;



void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(pin1, OUTPUT); // set pin 13 as output pin
  pinMode(pin2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(pin3, OUTPUT);

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

  digitalWrite(pin1, HIGH);  // turns red led on
  delay(100); // delay
  digitalWrite(pin1, LOW); // turns red led off
  delay(100); // delay 

  digitalWrite(pin2, HIGH);  // turns white led on
  delay(100); // delay
  digitalWrite(pin2, LOW); // turns white led off
  delay(100); // delay 

  digitalWrite(pin3, HIGH);  // turns blue led on
  delay(100); // delay
  digitalWrite(pin3, LOW); // turns blue led off
  delay(100); // delay

      <h2>Additional Questions</h2>
      <p>1.</p>
      <img src="voltage vs. led.png" />
      <p>2. The amount of LEDs is limited to the board's power current supply and pin limit. Each LED draws up to ~20mA, so N LEDs would draw around N*20mA.</p>
      <p>3. The human eye can perceive flicker up to a certain frequency, which is around 60 Hz. </p>
      <p>4. Yes, I was really confused about the calculations, and I asked ChatGPT to explain how to work through them. My prompt was "explain how to calculate the appropriate resistance to use for an LED" and I referred to other online sources and calculated the rest myself.</p>
